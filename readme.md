#PHP Flowchart Construct

PHP Flowchart is a Construct module which attempts to mimic the functionality of
a traditional flowchart diagram in PHP.

##What are Construct modules?
A Construct module is a collection of code which does not necessarily implement a function
as much as it implements an idea.

##Installation
We're still in development. When we are done we will add this module to Packagist.
Until then you can use this code by downloading it from this repository.
